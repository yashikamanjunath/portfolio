          <p>This project is a Image Gallery designed to showcase images in an organized and visually appealing way. Here's a detailed description:

            Features:
            Filterable Categories:The gallery images are categorized into groups such as "Food," "Nature," "Bikes," "Sketches," and "Moon."
            A set of buttons at the top allows users to filter images by category or view all images at once.

            Responsive Layout:The gallery adjusts to various screen sizes, ensuring a smooth user experience across devices.
            Images are displayed using a flexible grid layout.

            Lightbox Functionality:Clicking on an image opens it in a lightbox overlay, powered by the Magnific Popup library.
            The lightbox allows users to navigate through images using next/previous buttons.

            Hover Effects:Images scale slightly on hover, creating a zoom-in effect for better visual appeal.
            
            Dynamic Filtering:A JavaScript function toggles the visibility of images based on the selected category, providing a smooth filtering effect.
            
            Customizable Design:The gallery design includes custom styles for buttons, images, and layout, with easily modifiable CSS.

            Technology Stack:

            HTML5: For the structure of the gallery.
            CSS3: For styling, including hover effects, transitions, and responsiveness.
            JavaScript (jQuery): For handling the filtering logic and lightbox functionality.
            Magnific Popup: A lightweight library used for the lightbox effect.

            How It Works:

            Users can click on the buttons to filter images by their category.
            Clicking on an image opens a larger version in a modal (lightbox).
            The gallery is styled with vibrant colors and animations, enhancing the user experience.
            
            Ideal Use Cases:

            Art Portfolios: Showcasing artwork or photography in categorized sections.
            E-commerce: Displaying product images in a visually appealing way.
            Personal Projects: Hosting image collections for personal or academic purposes.

          <p>This project is a Calculator Web Application designed for basic arithmetic operations. Here's an overview:

            Features:
            Basic Arithmetic Operations:Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulo operations.
            
            Interactive Interface:Buttons for numbers (0-9), arithmetic operators, clear (C), backspace, and an equals sign for result calculation.
            Hover effects for a visually engaging experience.
           
            Keyboard Support:Users can interact with the calculator using keyboard input.
            Keys for numbers, operators, Enter for result, C for clear, and Backspace for deleting the last character.
            
            Real-Time Calculation:Dynamic input is displayed on the screen.
            Results are calculated in real-time when the equals sign is pressed.
            
            Error Handling:Invalid expressions result in an "Error" message instead of breaking the app.
            
            Responsive Design:The layout adapts to various screen sizes, making it mobile-friendly.
            
            Technology Stack:

            HTML:Structure of the calculator and buttons.
            CSS:Styling for a modern and responsive design.
            Gradient background, button hover effects, and an intuitive layout.
            JavaScript:Core functionality for calculations, input handling, and keyboard integration.
            Includes a sanitization mechanism for safer evaluation of mathematical expressions.

            How It Works:

            User Input:Inputs can be provided through button clicks or keyboard keys.
            Input appears dynamically in the display field.

            Calculation Logic:The Solve() function appends values to the display.
            The Result() function processes the input, replacing x with * for multiplication.
            The result is computed using JavaScript's Function() constructor.
            
            Control Features:Clear() removes all input.
            Back() deletes the last entered character.
            
            Keyboard Events:Listens for valid keys (numbers, operators, Enter, etc.) to ensure seamless user interaction.
            
            Styling Highlights:

            Background: A gradient that transitions between dark and light shades.
            Buttons: Rounded with hover scaling and color transitions for interactivity.
            Display: Clean, right-aligned text box styled for clarity.
            
            Ideal Use Cases:

            Quick calculations in the browser.
            Learning project for JavaScript beginners.
